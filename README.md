RUN LENGTH ENCODING (RLE) – TASK DESCRIPTION

The objective of this task is to implement a basic data compression algorithm using Run-Length Encoding (RLE). Data compression is used to reduce the size of data so that it can be stored and transmitted efficiently.

In this program, a text file is taken as input and compressed using the RLE technique. RLE works by replacing repeated characters with a single character followed by the number of times it appears consecutively. The program also supports decompression, which converts the compressed data back to its original form.

The tool reads the content from a text file, performs compression, and saves the compressed data into another file. During decompression, the program reads the compressed file and reconstructs the original text. Sample input and output are provided to show how the compression and decompression processes work.

This task helps in understanding the basics of data compression and file handling. It also improves programming skills related to string processing and file operations. The program demonstrates a simple and effective approach to text file compression using RLE.
